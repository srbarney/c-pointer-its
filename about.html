        <p class="white-text" style="margin-bottom: 34px;">This site is written as an open source project for an Intelligent Interactive Instructional Systems class taught by Professor Kurt VanLehn at Arizona State University. The goal of this site is to provide free instruction for anyone who wishes to learn about pointers in C programming. This program assumes that users already have a basic grasp on how to write basic C code. This program does not explain how to compile code or how to navigate an integrated development environment (IDE). What is does set out to do is teach what a pointer is and how and when to use it.</p>
